      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        <b>From the Catalog</b>: Contemporary open-source programming languages and frameworks are
        presented. The student considers design and development topics in system, graphical user
        interface, network, and web programming. Dynamic scripting languages are covered using
        object-oriented, concurrent, and functional programming paradigms. Concepts gained
        throughout the course are reinforced with numerous exercises which will culminate in an
        open-source programming project.
      </p>

      <section id="books">
        <h4>Required Books</h4>
        <p>
          My policy for assigning books: they are all required in the edition indicated; the total
          retail pricetag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $84 on the
          high end, assuming you opt for the electronic editions); and each book should be worthy
          of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the class has
          ended. My aim is to help you build your professional library, while also being sensitive
          to your personal finances.

    </section>
    <section id="assignments">
      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All major projects for this course will be submitted as URLs to Git repositories sent via
        email to the instructor, at karl.stolley@gmail.com, as will your initial Production Problem
        (thereafter, the instructor will directly check your fork of the Production Problems
        repository for your work). Emails should <b>not</b> include email attachments, but rather
        URLs pointing to your project’s Git repository or, for certain assignments as indicated,
        Dropbox Share URLs. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. No exceptions. All major projects must be submitted as specified
        in the project description, Weekly work is due before the start of the first class meeting
        each week.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Your active participation in class and especially in online discussions and chats on
        Basecamp is required both for your own success in the class, and for the success of the
        class as a whole. I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect
        you to be prepared to discuss that reading on Basecamp.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies as for any other
        course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared
        for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
        it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage
        all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer
        that you contact me via Basecamp Ping, email, or Google Hangouts, and well in advance of
        assignment and project deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
        up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
        is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
        important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
        before a project is due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
        accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
        certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
        also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add me as a collaborator,
        for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high value of
        establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias. Public
        accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your online
        presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when they
        look for you on Google and elsewhere.
      </p>

    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
        a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
        Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
        violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="special-needs">
      <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
      <p>
        I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all
        students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented
        disabilities. In order to receive formal accommodations, students must obtain a letter of
        accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a
        href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower,
        3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at
        312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135, or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
      </p>
      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
