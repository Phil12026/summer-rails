<p>
  Come take a deep dive into open-source web development powered by Ruby on Rails. This will be a
  production-intensive course in the practice and applied theory of full-stack web application
  development. You will develop a thorough understanding of model-view-controller (MVC)
  architecture, which will be coupled with bespoke database-driven application design, executed
  through an object-relational mapping (ORM) system. You will also have the opportunity to leverage
  MVC architecture to develop and interact with open data APIs expressed in JSON. You will also
  engage in mobile-first, responsive interface design through standards-compliant forms of HTML,
  CSS, and the DOM and a suite of a modular preprocessors including Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript.
</p>

<h2>You Should Take This Class</h2>
<p>
  Whether or not you have professional ambitions in web development, there are numerous higher-level
  principles and practices that you will engage in this summer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The professional necessity of tracking the development of active open-source projects such as
    Rails
  </li>
  <li>
    Exposure to a highly opinionated and uncompromising model-view-controller (MVC) application
    framework as represented by Ruby on Rails
  </li>
  <li>
    Full-stack development that closely knits the front- and back-end logic and execution common to
    MVC-based systems
  </li>
  <li>
    Mapping HTTP verbs onto system internals and methods, which leverage the capability of modern
    clients and browsers
  </li>
  <li>
    Intensive work with consoles and loggers to up your debugging game outside of clients and
    browsers
  </li>
  <li>
    Test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality, internal consistency, and to streamline
    code reviews
  </li>
  <li>
    Object-relational mapping (ORM) to abstract away databases and reconcile the set-theory behind
    databases with classes and methods that drive object-oriented languages
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuous integration (CI) as part of robust test-driven development and automated deployment
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
  There will be two major projects in this class. An individually developed prototype alpha app, and
  a group developed beta app culled from the individual alpha apps. Additionally, graduate students
  will be expected to more deeply investigate one of the core Rails framework’s modules (e.g.,
  Active Record, Action Cable, Active Support) and serve as in-house consultants on them.
</p>

<aside>
  <p>
    <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> purchase only the edition indicated; the total retail
    pricetag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $84 on the high end,
    assuming you opt for the electronic editions); and each book should be worthy of a place on
    your bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the class has ended.
  </p>

    not.
  </li>

    user, you’ll want the Ruby language package for Atom.

  </li>
  <li>
    The Node.js JavaScript runtime
